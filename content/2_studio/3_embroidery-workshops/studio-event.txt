Description: <p>The art of embroidery is one that can be found in every culture, and an art form with particularly important social and political significance throughout the SWANA region. We are thrilled to be offering these Intro to Embroidery courses in collaboration with Wafa Ghanim from <u><a href="https://www.tatreezandtea.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tatreez &amp; Tea</a></u>. Our intention is to bring our community together to learn, relearn and practice embroidery and reflect how the somatic experience of embroidering can be nourishing and healing.</p><p>Open to students of all skill levels, these workshops cover the basics of transferring one of four pre-selected patterns to fabric, threading a needle, one method of cross-stitching, and motif repetition. Pattern cards geared to beginners and more seasoned stitchers are offered by the instructors, and all supplies are provided. No experience is required.</p><p>Students will be contributing their embroidered design to the embroidery piece that will be a part of the Inverse Surveillance Project Installation that will be exhibited in museums throughout the country. Students will have the opportunity to embroider designs to take home to enjoy.</p>
