Description: <p>We are thrilled to invite our community* for the opening night of The Inverse Surveillance Project: an Immersive Community Archive experience that'll be exhibited in Bridgeview, IL from June 15th to July 9th. Join us to explore the immersive community archive that uses FBI documents about our community's surveillance as a canvas and is a historic endeavor and unapologetic refusal to allow the Islamophobic lens of the FBI shape our narrative or dictate our stories. There will be live music and outdoor refreshments will be served.</p><p><strong>*Note on Access:</strong> Access is limited to Muslim and/or Arab identifying community members who have endured government surveillance, whether personally and/or collectively. We invite other BIPOC to visit the installation between July 5th - July 9th. For those<strong> </strong>who do not identify with the aforementioned identities, you are welcome to support our work <a href="https://www.wmm.com/sponsored-project/the-feeling-of-being-watched/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. </p>
