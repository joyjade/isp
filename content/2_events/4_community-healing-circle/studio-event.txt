Description: <h3><u>Community Healing Circles</u></h3><p>Over the last 3 decades or more, wide-spread government surveillance of Muslims in the U.S. has greatly impacted our mental health and well-being. The stress we experience living in a climate of hostility, suspicion, bigotry, and discrimination is tremendous. We cannot easily quantify the emotional toll of racism, white supremacy and Islamophobia. Yet it is evident in feelings of increased anxiety, hypervigilance, threats of verbal and physical violence, instances of harassment, bullying, and profiling.</p><p>AND, as <strong>a community we have the power to heal those invisible wounds and rejoice in who we are, and all the gifts the Creator has bestowed upon us. </strong></p><p>This Community Healing Circle is a gathering which centers our need to name and acknowledge our experiences of racism, our strength and resilience in the face of these challenges, and together discover strategies to cope and thrive.</p><p></p><h3><u>Somatic Movement Class</u></h3><p>Each of us is born with an impulse towards wellness and whole health– this is our nature as humans. Along the way, hardship and oppression, and intergenerational histories impacted by trauma, create barriers and blockages to that health. Through the healing process we begin to open up these blockages as we gently move through the contractions and unclog the stuck places in our minds, our bodies, our emotions, our spirit. The goal and intention for the body-based healing process throughout this month is <strong>to support our community as we move through the barriers that hold us back from the wholeness and wellness we deserve; building a next generation of healed, empowered, individuals that will usher our communities into the next chapter of our story. </strong></p>
