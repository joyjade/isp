Heading:

## The Inverse Surveillance Project takes its name from the concept of citizen under-sight, an action undertaken *by* the subjects of surveillance, *of* the systems of surveillance. 
## It is an art project co-created with the Arab and Muslim American communities in Chicago, which seeks to build power, compel government transparency and co-create new narratives of our American Muslim experience through the creation of a site-specific, AR-fueled, counter-archive.
