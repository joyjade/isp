Description: The site-specific installation will be built and co- created in Bridgeview, Illinois. It will repurpose thousands of FBI documents collected during a decade of surveillance of the community and take the shape of a forty-foot labyrinth. Within the labyrinth, the redacted spaces in the documents — white holes where the government has violently disappeared information from the record — will be transformed into spaces of possibility. Spaces where a glitch, so to speak, in the bureaucratic documents can become a catalyst that initiates the community’s counter archive.
