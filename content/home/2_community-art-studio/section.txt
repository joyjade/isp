Description: <p>The Community Art Studio will be a place for our community to gather, create art, and imagine a world beyond surveillance and without raciliatized trauma—the pop-up studio will be open in Bridgeview, IL from June 15 - July 9 2022. Our intention is to reimagine how we react and respond to and process the trauma of surveillance in meaningful, culturally relevant and imaginative ways.</p><p>We invite our community to join Embroidery 101 classes every Tuesday-Saturday, Arts and Power building workshops every Wednesday, and Community Healing Workshops every Saturday. Every workshop is meant to offer different mediums that can offer us a path to healing from the violence of state sponsored trauma <em>in</em> <em>community</em>. </p>
