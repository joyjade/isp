Title: Co-Creation

----

Description: 

Using the definition found in Collective Wisdom, a field study spear-headed by our friend and mentor Katerina Cizek we understand co-creation to be an “alternative to a single-author vision, and involves a constellation of media production methods, frameworks, and feedback systems. In co-creation, projects emerge from a process, and evolve from within communities and with people, rather than for or about them. Co-creation also spans across and beyond disciplines and organizations, and can also involve non-human or beyond human systems. The concept of co-creation reframes the ethics of who creates, how, and why. Our research shows that co-creation interprets the world, and seeks to change it, through a lens of equity and justice.”
