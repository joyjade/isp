Description: This project includes designing and producing a co-creation process with Chicagoland Arab and Muslim communities. As Deepa Kumar writes, “the opposite of surveillance is not privacy…it is community.” The core of this project is developing a new arts-based model to address trauma from state surveillance and facilitate healing and care for our community, as a tool for liberation and power building. In cultivating intergenerational and interracial spaces to connect our histories to our present and ongoing conditions of surveillance, this project will inherently work toward breaking barriers of class, race, age, status, and gender within our vastly diverse Muslim communities and in its place build shared experiences that begin to weave our communities forward together.
