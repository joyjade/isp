Description:

During the five year investigation of surveillance in her community documented in the award winning film, THE FEELING OF BEING WATCHED (2018), Assia sought to disrupt government secrecy and took the FBI to federal court to compel them to make the records they collected about her community public. 

In the process of making the film, Assia filed a FOIA lawsuit against the FBI and won. A federal judge compelled the DOJ to release over 33,000 documents related to the FBI's surveillance of her community.
