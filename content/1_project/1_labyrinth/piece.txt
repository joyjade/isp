Title: Labyrinth

----

Description:

The installation will be built and co-created in the Chicagoland area and will take the shape of a 40-foot labyrinth. The walls of the labyrinth will consist of a datagram comprising the 33,000 redacted documents. 

The redacted spaces in the documents — holes where the government has disappeared information from the record — will be transformed into spaces of possibility, disrupting government secrecy. Spaces where a glitch in the bureaucratic record becomes a catalyst that initiates the community’s counter archive.
