Title: Labyrinth

----

Description: 

The walls of the labyrinth will consist of a datagram comprising 33,000 heavily redacted documents related to the FBI investigation.

Within the labyrinth, the redacted spaces in the documents — white holes where the government has violently disappeared information from the record — will be transformed into spaces of possibility. Spaces where a glitch, so to speak, in the bureaucratic documents can become a catalyst that initiates the community’s counter archive.
