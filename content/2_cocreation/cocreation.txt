Definition:

In (link: https://wip.mitpress.mit.edu/collectivewisdom text: Collective Wisdom target: _blank), a field study spear-headed by the MIT Open Documentary Lab and co-authored by our friend and mentor (link: https://wip.mitpress.mit.edu/user/katerina-cizek text: Katerina Cizek target: _blank) we understand co-creation to be: “an alternative to a single-author vision… a process that involves a constellation of media production methods, frameworks, and feedback systems.

In co-creation projects emerge from a process, they **evolve from within communities** and **with people**, rather than for or about them. The concept of co-creation reframes the ethics of who creates, how, and why. Our research shows that co-creation interprets the world, and seeks to change it, through a lens of equity and justice.”
