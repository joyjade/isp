Definition: <p>In <a href="https://wip.mitpress.mit.edu/collectivewisdom" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Collective Wisdom</a>, a field study spear-headed by the MIT Open Documentary Lab and co-authored by our friend and mentor <a href="https://wip.mitpress.mit.edu/user/katerina-cizek%20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Katerina Cizek</a> we understand co-creation to be: “an alternative to a single-author vision… a process that involves a constellation of media production methods, frameworks, and feedback systems. </p><p>In co-creation projects emerge from a process, they <strong>evolve from within communities</strong> and <strong>with people</strong>, rather than for or about them. The concept of co-creation reframes the ethics of who creates, how, and why. Our research shows that co-creation interprets the world, and seeks to change it, through a lens of equity and justice.”</p>
